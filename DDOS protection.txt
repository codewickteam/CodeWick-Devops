If a domain is not running on Cloudflare or any other dedicated DDoS protection service,we can still 
take certain measures to help prevent and mitigate DDoS attacks on a Linux server:
    Firewall Configuration: Set up and configure a firewall on your Linux server to block unauthorized 
    traffic and limit the number of connections from individual IP addresses. Tools like iptables and firewalld 
    can be used to manage the firewall rules effectively.

    Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting to restrict the number of requests from individual IP addresses or 
    specific ports. This can help mitigate certain types of DDoS attacks by limiting the impact of excessive 
    requests.

    DDoS Protection Modules: Some web servers, like Apache and Nginx, offer DDoS protection modules that
    can be configured to help mitigate certain types of attacks. For example, Apache's mod_evasive and 
    Nginx's ngx_http_limit_req_module can be used for rate limiting.

    Load Balancers: Implement load balancing using tools like HAProxy or Nginx to distribute traffic across 
    multiple servers. This can help distribute the load during a DDoS attack and prevent a single server from 
    being overwhelmed.

    Reverse Proxy: Use a reverse proxy server like Nginx or Varnish to act as an intermediary between the   
    client and the web server. A reverse proxy can help filter and block malicious traffic before it reaches the 
    actual server.

    Monitoring and Traffic Analysis: Set up monitoring tools to keep track of your server's performance and  
    network traffic. By monitoring traffic patterns, you can identify potential DDoS attacks and take appropriate 
    actions.

    Cloud-based DDoS Protection: Some cloud hosting providers offer DDoS protection services that you can  
    enable for your servers. These services use large-scale infrastructure to absorb and filter malicious traffic  
    before it reaches your server.

    Keep Software Updated: Regularly update your server's operating system, web server software, and any 
    applications running on it. Keeping your software up-to-date helps patch known vulnerabilities that 
    attackers might exploit.

    Blocking Known Malicious IPs: Keep an eye on logs and block known malicious IP addresses manually or
    use tools like Fail2ban to automate the process.

    Scaling Resources: In case of an ongoing DDoS attack, scaling up server resources or temporarily using a
    Content Delivery Network (CDN) may help handle the increased traffic.

Step 1: Set Up a Firewall

   1. Install a firewall tool like iptables (or firewalld for CentOS/RHEL systems) if not already available on 
       your server.

    For iptables:
    --sudo apt update
    --sudo apt install iptables
    
    For firewalld (CentOS/RHEL):
    --sudo yum install firewalld
    
   2. Configure the firewall to allow only necessary incoming connections and block unauthorized traffic. 
       For example, allow HTTP(S) traffic and SSH access while blocking other unnecessary ports.

Step 2: Implement Rate Limiting

    i) Use the appropriate DDoS protection module for your web server (e.g., mod_evasive for Apache
       or ngx_http_limit_req_module for Nginx).

   ii) Configure rate limiting rules to limit the number of requests from individual IP addresses or specific
       ports. This helps prevent certain types of DDoS attacks.

Step 3: Set Up a Reverse Proxy

   1. Install and configure a reverse proxy server like Nginx or Varnish.

    For Nginx:
    --sudo apt update
    --sudo apt install nginx

    For Varnish:
    --sudo apt update
    --sudo apt install varnish
    
   2. Configure the reverse proxy to handle incoming requests and act as a filter for malicious traffic before
       forwarding requests to the backend web server.

Step 4: Enable Load Balancing (Optional)

    1. Install and configure a load balancer like HAProxy or Nginx to distribute incoming traffic across multiple
    backend servers.

    For HAProxy:
    --sudo apt update
    --sudo apt install haproxy

    2. Set up the load balancer to distribute the load evenly across the backend servers. Load balancing helps 
    distribute traffic during a DDoS attack, preventing a single server from being overwhelmed.

Step 5: Monitor Traffic and Server Performance

   1. Install monitoring tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or Munin to keep track of your server's performance 
       and network traffic.

   2. Set up alerts to notify you of any abnormal traffic patterns that might indicate a DDoS attack.

Step 6: Consider Cloud-based DDoS Protection (Optional)

   1. If available, consider using a cloud hosting provider that offers DDoS protection services. Many providers 
    have built-in DDoS protection infrastructure that can help absorb and filter malicious traffic before it 
    reaches your server.

Step 7: Keep Software Updated

   1. Regularly update your server's operating system, web server software, and any applications running on it.

   2. Keeping your software up-to-date helps patch known vulnerabilities that attackers might exploit.

Step 8: Block Known Malicious IPs

   1. Monitor your server logs for suspicious activity and identify known malicious IP addresses.

   2. Use tools like Fail2ban to automatically block or temporarily ban malicious IPs.

Step 9: Scale Resources (During Ongoing Attacks)

   1. In case of an ongoing DDoS attack, consider scaling up server resources or temporarily using a Content 
       Delivery Network (CDN) to help handle the increased traffic.

Note:  This provides general steps for improving DDoS protection on a Linux server. For comprehensive DDoS 
protection, especially against large-scale attacks, it is recommended to consider specializedDDoS protection 
services or cloud-based DDoS protection solutions.
