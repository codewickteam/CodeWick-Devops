"Creating three-tier application Infra using Ansible and terraform"

step 1: Set up your project directory:
1.1) Create a new directory for your project.
-mkdir task1
1.2) Inside the project directory, create the following subdirectories: ansible, terraform, and inventory.
-cd task1
-mkdir ansible
-mkdir teraform
-mkdir inventory

step 2: Set up the Ansible configuration:
2.1) Inside the ansible directory, create an ansible.cfg file with the following content:
[defaults]
inventory = ../inventory
remote_user = <ssh_username>
private_key_file = <path_to_ssh_private_key>

step 3: Define the inventory:
3.1) Inside the inventory directory, create a file named hosts and define your hosts. For a three-tier 
application, you typically have separate groups for web servers, application servers, and database servers.
For example:
[web_servers]
web1 ansible_host=<web1_ip_address>
web2 ansible_host=<web2_ip_address>

[app_servers]
app1 ansible_host=<app1_ip_address>
app2 ansible_host=<app2_ip_address>

[db_servers]
db1 ansible_host=<db1_ip_address>
db2 ansible_host=<db2_ip_address>

step 4: Set up Terraform:
4.1) Inside the terraform directory, create a Terraform configuration file, for example, main.tf, with the 
infrastructure definition. Here's an example for a simple setup:
# Provider configuration (e.g., AWS)
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

# Define resources (e.g., EC2 instances)
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  count         = 2
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  # Other configuration parameters like ami, subnet_id, security_groups, etc.
  # ...
}

# Similar resource blocks for app and db instances
# ...

step 5: Use Ansible with Terraform:
5.1) Inside the ansible directory, create a playbook, for example, playbook.yml, to configure the 
infrastructure created by Terraform. Here's an example of how you can set up the web servers:
- hosts: web_servers
  become: yes
  tasks:
  - name: Install and configure web server
    # Add your web server configuration tasks here
    # ...

step 6: Run Terraform:
6.1) Change to the terraform directory and run the following commands:
-terraform init   # Initialize Terraform
-terraform apply  # Create the infrastructure

step 7: Run Ansible playbook:
7.1) Change to the ansible directory and run the following command:
-ansible-playbook playbook.yml
