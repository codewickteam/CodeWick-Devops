Deployment of Node.js Application using Docker.
Prerequisites:
1. Docker: Ensure that Docker is installed and running on the deployment machine. 
--sudo apt install docker      #Only if docker is not installed.
2. Create a new directory for your Node.js application.
--mkdir <name of directory>
3. Enter into that directory using "cd" command.
--cd <name of directory> 
4. Create a new file named "Dockerfile" in the root directory of your Node.js application.
5. Now Building the Docker Image:
    5(a). Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of your Node.js application (where the Dockerfile is located).
    5(b). Run the following command to build the Docker image:
             --docker build -t <name> .
Note: You can change the <name> to name of the application you are building.
6. The -t flag specifies the name and tag for the image (e.g. my-node-app).
7. Running the Docker Container:
--docker run -d -p 3000:3000 <name>
8.Test the Application: using the given URL below 
http://localhost:3000

Note: If you change the port no., then you also have to change the port no. on the Testing the Application URL.
